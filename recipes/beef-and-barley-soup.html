            The Instant Pot cooks meats and grains beautifully and to tender perfection. 
            Therefore, it only makes sense to combine the two and churn out a big pot of the most outrageous Beef & Barley Soup you've ever known. 
            This is a very popular recipe from my first (orange) cookbook.

        <ul>2 bay leaves

                2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
            </li>
            <li>
                1 yellow onion, diced
            </li>
            <li>
                1 large (or 2 medium) carrots, peeled and diced
            </li>
            <li>
                2 ribs celery, sliced into 1/4-inch pieces
            </li>
            <li>
                2 pounds chuck meat, cut into chunky (yet bite-size) cubes
            </li>
            <li>
                6 cloves (2 tablespoons) garlic, minced
            </li>
            <li>
                6 cups beef broth
            </li>
            <li>
                1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
            </li>
            <li>
                1 1/2 tablespoons seasoned salt
            </li>
            <li>
                2 teaspoons dried thyme
            </li>
            <li>
                1 teaspoon black pepper
            </li>
            <li>
                1 pound baby or fingerling potatoes, skins-on and quartered/roughly chopped
            </li>
            <li>
                2 bay leaves
            </li>
        </ul> <br>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Add the olive oil to the Instant Pot, hit Sauté and Adjust so it's on the More or High setting. 
                After 3 minutes of the oil heating, add the onion, carrot and celery. 
                Sauté for about 5 minutes, until it softens just a bit.
            </li><br>
            <li>
                Add the beef and garlic and sauté for another 2-3 minutes, until the beef is lightly browned on the edges.
            </li><br>
            <li>
                Add the broth, barley, Worcestershire sauce, seasoned salt, thyme and black pepper. 
                Use a wooden spoon to give it a good stir, scraping any browned bits up from the bottom of the pot. 
                Top with the potatoes and bay leaves.
            </li><br>
            <li>
                Secure the lid, move the valve to the sealing position, hit Cancel and then hit Manual or Pressure Cook for 20 minutes. 
                When done, allow a 15-minute natural release (meaning you do nothing for 15 minutes) followed by a quick release.
            </li><br>
            <li>
                Ladle into bowls and serve with some bread (be it crusty French/Italian or garlic knots)!
            </li>
        </ol>
